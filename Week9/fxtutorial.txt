From the File menu, choose New Project.
In the JavaFX application category, choose JavaFX FXML Application. Click Next.
Name the project FXMLExample and click Finish.
NetBeans IDE opens an FXML project that includes the code for a basic Hello World application. The application includes three files:
FXMLExample.java. This file takes care of the standard Java code required for an FXML application.
Sample.fxml. This is the FXML source file in which you define the user interface.
SampleController.java. This is the controller file for handling the mouse and keyboard input.
Rename SampleController.java to FXMLExampleController.java so that the name is more meaningful for this application.
In the Projects window, right-click SampleController.java and choose Refactor then Rename.
Enter FXMLExampleController, and click Refactor.
Rename Sample.fxml to fxml_example.fxml.
Right-click Sample.fxml and choose Rename.
Enter fxml_example and click OK.
